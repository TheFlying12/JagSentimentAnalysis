"We gather here today to bid farewell to Jaguar, a once-proud marque that embodied elegance, performance, and character. Jaguar was more than a car manufacturer; it was a symbol of passion and untamed freedom.<br><br>Tragically, Jaguar did not fall to the passage of time or technological progress but to a wave of conformity. In the Woke Bubble, it lost its spirit, its boldness, and ultimately its identity.<br><br>Today, we mourn more than a brand—we mourn an era of courage and individuality. Yet, Jaguar lives on in memories, in garages, and in the hearts of its admirers.<br><br>Rest in peace, Jaguar. Your spirit will never fade.",Neutral
