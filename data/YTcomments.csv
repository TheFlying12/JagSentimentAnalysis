Copy nothing? More like understand nothing.
"De macho Alfa lomo plateado pelo en pecho a compañere, nunca pensé que una automotriz saliera del closet."
Où sont les voitures ? Cest quoi cest guignols en tutu ? Cest une blague jaguar pour le 1er avril a bah non on est en decembre. Bye bye jaguar
This thing is just a waste of time where is the old jaguar we all wanted to see
WTF did I just watch?
How old was the child that designed this add ? Needs a lot of help
"We gather here today to bid farewell to Jaguar, a once-proud marque that embodied elegance, performance, and character. Jaguar was more than a car manufacturer; it was a symbol of passion and untamed freedom.<br><br>Tragically, Jaguar did not fall to the passage of time or technological progress but to a wave of conformity. In the Woke Bubble, it lost its spirit, its boldness, and ultimately its identity.<br><br>Today, we mourn more than a brand—we mourn an era of courage and individuality. Yet, Jaguar lives on in memories, in garages, and in the hearts of its admirers.<br><br>Rest in peace, Jaguar. Your spirit will never fade."
What a terrible day to have eyes
Yes please copy nothing from this advert.
BRUH
Caralh0 afrescalharam até a Jaguar😮😮😮
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
lol have a bud light in your Fahjuar on your way to the new woke Disney movie and find new ways to destroy everything on your way!
"Lol, the Bud Light of car commercials ......"
Enna elavu da 😂😂
Jaguar in it&#39;s death throws. It will be gone in two years
"I&#39;m confused, how exactly does a bunch of clowns clowning about, sell more cars when the brand isn&#39;t even mentioned (apart from a small square in the corner), nor a single car shown?"
Is jaguar being a gay now ?? Or  a jewellery shop
Evolution of 🤴 to 🤡
“This will help us sell more cars.”<br>What cars?
I guess I found something worse than Thick of It?
budweiser ass ad
You just copied the left wing lunatics ad formula! lmao.
&quot;Two girls one cup&quot; has more class than this ad.
I’ll take “How to ruin a car company in less than a year” Alex
Que bosta
Vine a ver los comerciales de jaguar por la mole en la cotorrisa 😅
That&#39;s how you destroy your Company. Seems like Budweiser is not enough of a warning.
"I have a friend who bought one earlier this year.  I&#39;m going to ask him if he plans to get rid of it, so people won&#39;t think he&#39;s weird.  If he gives me a good enough price, I&#39;ll buy it and swap the engine into my Corolla, and somehow stick a Toyota emblem on top of the engine."
Not many transgender coffee shop baristas buy jaguars
What the hell is that?
Just in case you cant see dislikes: there are 31.000 dislikes
THIS IS SICK! BUYING ONE RN
I think these people are going crazy 😡😡😡😡
No wonder Elon Musk asked if they still still sell cars 😂
Modern art has caught up to modern automobile industry😭😭😭
La mole tenía razón
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ridiculo
"Good, spend money create rubbish."
Trying to go woke
Deserves to be the most disliked video on Youtube
Boycott this brand now
"Look at the Jaguar Type 00 review. It&#39;s like a car from Sims 4, in this ice cream-pink an crazy design. No wonder there is no message in this buzz-creating ad, it is here as a statement that the car says everything. This does not eliminate the very unprofessional reaction of the management to critics to this ad though - you need better public speaking and PR professionals to prepare your management to defend such turns.."
&quot;Copy nothing&quot;... <br><br>Copies Budweiser...<br><br><br>😂😂😂😂😂
The most groundbreaking thing is that they left the comments open.
???????????
Its a psyop everybody is gay Andrew Tate predicted this someone saved jaguar from bankruptcy and is forcing them to do this g@y ads RIP to Jaguar..... stay sharp fellas👍🏾
"Ля эти кончи тож деградировать начали, попробуйте покататься на бомбе &quot;толстяк&quot;"
I&#39; m sorry your name new is gay war 🤮👎
obviously owned by TATA
My mate told me about this I thought he was joking.
If just Enzo Ferrari saw this...
another company will follow go woke go broke what they are selling anyways
The CEO should look for another job ... Budweiser all over again 😂
Go WOKE Go BROKE
"I don&#39;t have the money for a Jaguar right now, but I&#39;ve always wanted a real, expensive Jaguar. I work hard, I&#39;m well-qualified, and I&#39;ve started my own business, which is going up. I&#39;ll make the money, but I don&#39;t want a Jaguar anymore."
👎
Literally no one: I hope Jaguar goes woke<br><br>Jaguar: Hold my Pumpkin spiced Latte
This feels like a parody of modern society and advertising
It actually signifies who is going to be the elite class in the future.......... masculinity will vanish..... Brands knew it
ajajajjajajajaa
CONGRATULATIONS!!! You look like Primark knock-offs
Create Exuberant 😂😂😂
"El peor comercial de jaguar que he visto , hay mejores comerciales"
"Here&#39;s an idea: Hire Henry Cavill, have him talk about the Jaguar in his British accent, film him driving it, put the Jaguar emblem back on the car and stop messing around. Learn from Chrysler and the Cordoba, with the manly and elegant Ricardo Montalbán."
"Question: What is the relationship between a classy, ​​powerful car and a bunch of freaks and morons?"
Dislike
"😂😂 a car comercial with no car.. go woke, go broke.."
copy nothing.... buy nothing from woke companies
I thought this was a joke!  Fire everyone associated!  This failure WILL hit the taxpayers.  Make sure they pay hell 1st.
"Go woke, Go broke, what a bunch of losers JAGUAR, now I&#39;ll be ashamed to think wanting 1a jaguar!!"
Remember when car brands focused on making good cars? Gonna miss that
I like it
Jaguar is trying to hard they say copy nothing but they kinda fit it in with other companies destroying their own image
La peor publicidad de la historia como pueden un mal publicista hacer caer tan bajo una marca
Acabaram com a marca
Horrível
"I&#39;d rather they sold it to the Germans, who then build exquisite classic sports saloons under the prewar SS Jaguar brand, built at Eva Braun&#39;s Lane, Coventry<br>Edit: less of a nightmare than this pitiful woke BS"
1. Not a single car<br>2. She looks like moss from he it crowd
Bro the concept car rear looks like a cooling vent
<b>Insert Travolta Meme here</b> &quot;Where car?&quot;
Can&#39;t wait to see the memes calling guys with jags gay. The bud light ones were glorious.
incompetence
Mars is shown to make Elon Musk Angry
Watching this ad on LGTV
"Go woke, go broke"
So stunning and so brave 😍
Ehh. a Woke advert 🤮🤮🤮
That was horrible I can&#39;t see those things and bot feel like i wanna vomit
Hair bridge with Asian. WOW How PC are you.
Like si veniste por la cotorrisa
sad
The definition of disappointment
"Jaguar are supposed to be targeting rich people with their adverts, not art school rejects"
Brilliant I will never buy a jaguar now
Maybe they wanna sell parfum now
🤢🤮😵‍💫
Oh ist das peinlich 🤣🤣 Das wird Jaguars Untergang.  Wie auch die Dislike Option hier ausgeschaltet ist. kommt nicht gut wenn man der Minderheit hier eine Bühne gibt und dann man keine Negativen Daumen da lassen kann. Scheint wohl wieder nur in eine Richtung zu gehen zum Thema &quot;Jeder darf sein wie er ist&quot; 🤣🤣
"Guess you didn&#39;t learn anything from Budweiser, huh?"
🤔
